            <div class="content">
                <p>With over 15 years of experience as a software engineer, my expertise lies in front-end development. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality and scalable websites, web, and mobile applications using React and React Native.</p>
                <p>I excel at bridging the gap between designers and back-end developers, appreciating the value of responsive and accessible designs, which makes me a favourite collaborator for designers. Similarly, my ability to create structured, maintainable, and testable codebases has earned the trust and admiration of fellow developers.</p>
                <p>Throughout my career, I have successfully delivered projects for both small and large clients, including Citi bank, Telegraph, Sky, LBi, Barclays, E.on, and others. I am always eager to take on new and challenging projects where I can showcase my skills as a top-class engineer and mentor, ensuring the delivery of exceptional user experiences for clients.</p>
                <p>Personally, a father of three, gamer, geek.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I look forward to meeting you!</p>
